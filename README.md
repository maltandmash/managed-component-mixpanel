## 🚀 Quickstart local dev environment

1. Make sure you're running node version >=20.
2. Install dependencies with `npm i`
3. Run unit test watcher with `npm run test:dev`

## 🔧 Setup in Cloudflare Zaraz

### Cloudflare Worker Setup (Git Deploy)

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Create a Workers KV namespace in Cloudflare:
   - Go to `Storage & Databases` -> `Workers KV` -> `Create Instance`.
   - Name it `managed-component-mixpanel-kv`.
   - Copy the namespace ID (32-char hex).
3. Create the Worker from your fork:
   - Go to `Workers & Pages` -> `Create Application`.
   - Click `Continue with GitHub`.
   - Select your forked repository.
4. Configure build/deploy in Cloudflare:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Deploy command:
     `KV_ID="${KV_NAMESPACE_ID:-$KV_NAMESPACE_ID_FALLBACK}"; test -n "$KV_ID" || { echo "Missing KV namespace ID"; exit 1; }; sed "s/__KV_NAMESPACE_ID__/$KV_ID/g" wrangler.custom-mc.template.toml > wrangler.custom-mc.toml && printf "y\nn\n" | npx managed-component-to-cloudflare-worker ./dist/index.js custom-mc-managed-component-mixpanel ./wrangler.custom-mc.toml`
   - Worker name: `custom-mc-managed-component-mixpanel`.
5. Run first deploy from Cloudflare UI.
   - First deploy can fail before variables/bindings are fully configured.
6. Add KV binding in the Worker:
   - Go to `Workers & Pages` -> `custom-mc-managed-component-mixpanel` -> `Bindings` -> `Add Binding`.
   - Type: `KV namespace`
   - Variable name: `KV`
   - KV namespace: `managed-component-mixpanel-kv`
7. Add KV namespace ID as a build variable:
   - Go to `Workers & Pages` -> `custom-mc-managed-component-mixpanel` -> `Settings` -> `Build` -> `Variables and secrets`.
   - Add `KV_NAMESPACE_ID` with value set to the namespace ID copied earlier.
8. Redeploy:
   - Go to `Deployments` -> latest build -> `Retry build`.

### Mixpanel Custom Managed Component setup in Zaraz

1. Go to `Delivery & performance` -> `Web tag management` -> `Tag setup`.
2. Click `Add new tool`.
3. Select `Workers`, then choose `custom-mc-managed-component-mixpanel`.
4. Continue and grant required permissions.
5. Name and configure the tool:
   - Settings:
     - `isEU` = `true` for EU data residency projects.
     - Leave `isEU` `false` for US projects.
   - Default fields:
     - `@token` = Mixpanel project token.
6. Continue, enable tracking actions as needed, then save and publish.

### Mixpanel Event to add user profile details first time - $set_once

Use a `set_user_property` action to set user profile fields on first login/sign-up.

1. Before any `zaraz.track(...)` calls, set a unique user id via `zaraz.set(...)` so `$distinct_id` is available.
2. Send a track event with profile data, for example:

```js
zaraz.track('mp_profile_setup_completed', {
  email: 'info@example.com',
  first_name: 'Jane',
  last_name: 'Doe',
  phone: '+353 86 123 4567',
  created: '2023-10-27T14:30:00Z', // ISO 8601 UTC
  date_of_birth: '1989-01-15T00:00:00Z', // ISO 8601 UTC
  value: 125.0,
  currency: 'EUR',
})
```

3. In Zaraz, create variables for the properties you want to forward.
4. Create a new action:
   - Trigger: the track event containing profile data (for example `mp_profile_setup_completed`)
   - Action type: `Custom`
   - Event name: `set_user_property`
5. Save the action, then add fields:
   - `user-set-action` = `profile-set-once`
   - Map each field to its matching variable value:
     - `$city`
     - `$country_code`
     - `$created`
     - `$date_of_birth`
     - `$distinct_id`
     - `$email`
     - `$first_name`
     - `$last_name`
     - `$phone`
     - `$region`
     - `$timezone`
