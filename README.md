## 🚀 Quickstart local dev environment

1. Make sure you're running node version >=20.
2. Install dependencies with `npm i`
3. Run unit test watcher with `npm run test:dev`

## 🔧 Setup in Cloudflare & Zaraz

### Cloudflare Worker Setup (Git Deploy)

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. In Cloudflare, create a Workers KV namespace:
   - Go to `Storage & Databases` -> `Workers KV` -> `Create Instance`.
   - Name: `managed-component-mixpanel-kv`.
   - Copy the generated Namespace ID (32-char hex) and save it.
3. Create the Worker:
   - Go to `Workers & Pages` -> `Create Application`.
   - Click `Continue with GitHub`.
   - Connect GitHub and select your forked repository.
4. Set up the application:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Deploy command:
     `KV_ID="${KV_NAMESPACE_ID:-$KV_NAMESPACE_ID_FALLBACK}"; test -n "$KV_ID" || { echo "Missing KV namespace ID"; exit 1; }; sed "s/__KV_NAMESPACE_ID__/$KV_ID/g" wrangler.custom-mc.template.toml > wrangler.custom-mc.toml && printf "y\nn\n" | NPM_CONFIG_CACHE=/tmp/.npm npx --yes managed-component-to-cloudflare-worker ./dist/index.js custom-mc-managed-component-mixpanel ./wrangler.custom-mc.toml`
   - In `Advanced settings`, add environment variable:
     - Name: `KV_NAMESPACE_ID`
     - Value: the namespace ID copied in step 2
   - Keep worker name: `custom-mc-managed-component-mixpanel`
5. Deploy.

### Mixpanel Custom Managed Component setup in Zaraz

1. Go to `Delivery & performance` -> `Web tag management` -> `Tag setup`.
2. Click `Add new tool`.
3. Select `Workers`, then choose `custom-mc-managed-component-mixpanel`.
4. Continue and grant required permissions.
5. Name and configure the tool:
   - Settings:
     - `isEU` = `true` for EU data residency projects.
     - Leave `isEU` `false` for US projects.
   - Default fields:
     - `@token` = Mixpanel project token.
6. Continue, enable tracking actions as needed, then save and publish.

### Mixpanel Event to add user profile details first time - $set_once

Use a `set_user_property` action to set user profile fields on first login/sign-up.

1. Before any `zaraz.track(...)` calls, set a stable user id via `zaraz.set(...)` so events include `$user_id` and Mixpanel can merge with its generated `$device_id` (Simplified ID Merge API flow).
2. Send a track event with profile data, for example:

```js
zaraz.track('mp_profile_setup_completed', {
  email: 'info@example.com',
  first_name: 'Jane',
  last_name: 'Doe',
  phone: '+353 86 123 4567',
  created: '2023-10-27T14:30:00Z', // ISO 8601 UTC
  date_of_birth: '1989-01-15T00:00:00Z', // ISO 8601 UTC
  value: 125.0,
  currency: 'EUR',
})
```

3. In Zaraz, create variables for the properties you want to forward.
4. Create a new action:
   - Trigger: the track event containing profile data (for example `mp_profile_setup_completed`)
   - Action type: `Custom`
   - Event name: `set_user_property`
5. Save the action, then add fields:
   - `user-set-action` = `profile-set-once`
   - Map each field to its matching variable value:
     - `$city`
     - `$country_code`
     - `$created`
     - `$date_of_birth`
     - `$distinct_id`
     - `$email`
     - `$first_name`
     - `$last_name`
     - `$phone`
     - `$region`
     - `$timezone`

## ⚙️ Tool Settings

> Settings are used to configure the tool in a Component Manager config file

### Mixpanel Project Token `string`

The Mixpanel Project Token is the unique identifier of your Mixpanel project. In Zaraz, set this as Default Field `@token`. It can also be overridden per event via payload keys `@token`, `$token`, or `token`. [Learn more](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004502806-Find-Project-Token-)

### Is EU region `boolean`

In Zaraz, create `isEU` as a custom field in Settings and set `isEU` to `true` if you are enrolled in EU Data Residency. Endpoint routing is:
- `true` -> `https://api-eu.mixpanel.com/...`
- `false` (or unset) -> `https://api.mixpanel.com/...`
[Learn more](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039135652-Data-Residency-in-EU)

## 🧱 Fields Description

> Fields are properties that can/must be sent with certain events

### Track event name `string`

`event` is the event name that will be sent with a Track event. [Learn more](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/track-event)

### Identified ID `string` (legacy)

`$identified_id` is part of the older identity flow and is kept for backward compatibility. Current recommended setup is:
- send `$user_id` on events and rely on Mixpanel-generated `$device_id` for Simplified ID Merge
- send `$distinct_id` when updating profile data (`set_user_property`)
[Learn more](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/3600410397711#user-identification)

### Alias `string`

`alias` which Mixpanel will use to remap one id to another. Multiple aliases can point to the same identifier. It must be provided with Create alias event. [Learn more](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041039771#user-identification)

### Group key `string`

`$group_key` is a unique key for a group of user profiles. It must be provided with Update group properties, Delete group properties or Delete group profile events. [Learn more](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025333632)

### Ignore alias `boolean`

`$ignore_alias` is used to ignore alias when deleting a profile. It must be provided with Delete user profile event. [Learn more](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/delete-profile)
